Database Design
---------------

The database designed for this web application holds data related to archery such as recurve archers, compound archer, scores, countries, olympics, sponsors etc.

Countries table is the most referenced table in the database since it is used by all group members.

Tables those are in relation with others are cascaded to keep referential integrity.

PostgreSQL is the relational database management system used in Database Design.

E/R diagrams of the database will be given seperately by each member.
